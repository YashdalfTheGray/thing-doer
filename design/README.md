# Design

This folder contains 4 living documents that will see updates as the design of this project evolves. Each file contains the design of one major component of the system. All details about the operation and the interlinking to other components are specified in that one file, on a best effort basis. The only exception to this rule is the [architecture doc](architecture.md) which goes over the system and how it is organized.

The components are as follows -

- [Datastore](datastore.md)
- [Processor node](processor.md)
- [Observer node](observer.md)
